# Simulating-the-One-Dimensional-Heat-Equation-of-a-Flate-Plate-in-Java
Using Java and the Open Source Physics Library, this project presents the development, implementation, and visualization of a numerical solver for the one-dimensional (1D) heat conduction equation for a flat plate using finite difference methods.
